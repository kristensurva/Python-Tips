	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	
	<h2>Indentation</h2>
	<p>In Python indentation is very important. Python uses whitespace indentation to separate code into blocks.</p>
	
	<h2>Variables</h2>
	<p>Let's look at an example "x = 2". This translates to variable name x receives a numeric value 2.</p>
	
	<h2>Statements</h2>
	<p>With statements you can write your code.<br>Some of the most important statements are:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>"if" - it conditionally executes a block of code, along with "else" and "elif"(which is "else" and "if" put together)</li>
			<li>"for" - iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.</li>
			<li>"while" - executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.</li>
			<li>"import" - it is used for importing modules.</li>
		</ul>
