	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<h4>What is Python?</h4>
	<p>Python is the fastest growing programming language in the world right now and it is on its way to become the most popular programming language.<br>
	Python is used for data analysis, artificial intelligence and machine learning, automation.</p>
	<h4>Why use Python?</h4>
	<p>Python has a simple and beginner-friendly syntax. You can write your program with fewer lines of code and with less time.<br>
	To use Python you don't have to be a software developer, Python is also great for accountants and mathematicians for example, because with Python you can automatize lots of your daily tasks.
	</p>
	<h4>Indentation</h4>
	<p>In Python indentation is very important. Python uses whitespace indentation to separate code into blocks.</p>
	
	<h4>Variables</h4>
	<p>Let's look at an example "x = 2". This translates to variable name x receives a numeric value 2.</p>
	
	<h4>Statements</h4>
	<p>With statements you can write your code.<br>Some of the most important statements are:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>"if" - it conditionally executes a block of code, along with "else" and "elif"(which is "else" and "if" put together)</li>
			<li>"for" - iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.</li>
			<li>"while" - executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.</li>
			<li>"print" - with this statement you can print whatever you want.</li>
			<li>"import" - it is used for importing modules.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>EXCERCISE</h4>
	<p>Try to write down what should the code look like if you wanted to print "Hello world!" in Python.</p>
